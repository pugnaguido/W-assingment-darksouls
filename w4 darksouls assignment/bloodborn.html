        atmosphere

    <p>
        out of all the games i have talked about this game definetly has one of the 
        best vibes thorughout the game. the world crumbles when you do this and
        people go insane when you do that. 
        <br>
        it is an eldritch being game where you are a hunter hunting these so called eldritch
        horors gaining insight on them allowing you to see them. which might be a good thing or not.
        <br> 
        an old timey london feel thorughout the cities with a creepy feel 
        everywhere else.
