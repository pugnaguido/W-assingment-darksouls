    <h3>
        my first run
    </h3>
    <p>
        my very first time playing a souls game I quit at the very first boss fight cause i was bad
        at the game. granted i was like 5 or somwhere around htere but still. <br>
        after that i proceeded to reattempt to play darksouls and proceeded through th egame very slowly.
        it took alsmot 18 hours of playtime for me to beat the game. now i can fully beat the
        game in one day if i want to. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>
        atmosphere
    </h3>
    <p>
        The atmosphere of darksouls 3 is definetly one of my favorites but is considered laking
        compared to other soulsborn games.<br>
        you awake in a grave and work youre way through undead castles and settlemsents while workikng to kill
        undead or living things to become the equivalent to the god of fire.
        <br>
        using music and fights tailored around making you feel either helpless or super
        powerful gives you a feeling of acomplishment everytime you beat a difficult fight.
        <br>
        A heavy acstetic in all of the souls games is the bonfire. it is teh one safe
        spot to rest and heal. it gives you back youre healing and allows you to teleport between them.
