    <h2>
        Hi my name is Skyler and i really like Souls like games.<br>
        I feel souls games are the pinacle of gaming where an RPG mixes
        with a hardcore gritty survival like game. <br>
        I will be going a little more in depth on my favorite soul
        games on different pages.
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Darksouls 3
    </h3>
    <p>
        Darksouls 3 is the game i started the souls series with, it is
        my personal favorite though i see the appeal of others.<br>
        it gives me the most nostalgia and is the game i consider myself the best at through the souls series
        <br>
        the world is well built and special for darksouls games as even when oyure teleported you
        can still see other places.

    <h3>
        Darksouls 1
    </h3>
    <p>
        Darksouls 1 is probably my second favorite game in the franchise<br>
        it is a wonderfully developed game thatfor its time was a masterpiece.<br>
        it was even considered to be the start of the souls franchise even though it
        wasnt the start of the souls series. <br>
        that award goes to demon sould though i havent played it so i wont be tlaking about
        it during this website.

    <h3>
        Bloodborne
    </h3>
    <p>
        This will be the last game i talk about for now<br>
        bloodborne was the second game i played form the sould borne franchise.
        <br>
        it is a game thats gameplay was worse than darksouls but the world building
        and atmosphere was intense. <br>
        definetly some of the best world building and atmosphere in any game i have ever
        played. its insane how much you can do with a litle bit of music and some bakcground
        attention
