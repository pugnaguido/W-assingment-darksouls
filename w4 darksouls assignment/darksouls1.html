    <h3>
        atmosphere
    </h3>
    <p>
        to many people darksouls 1 world building and atmosphere were a beautiful artpiece 
        that many proclaim to be unmatched. 
        <br>
        the way the world bends ands twists as you explore it with youre actions always having consequenses
        and issues with npcs. 
        <br>
        you are able to change almost anything and everything about the world 
        all the way down to burning it or letting darkness fall upon the world. 
        <br>
        there will be a lot of people and things along the way to or hinder the journey thorugh the 
        world and in the ened the ruler is who you end. either becoming or sacraficing the final 
        ruler.

    <h3>
        my first playthorugh
    </h3>
    <p>
        i do have to give darksouls 1 a good vote as the gameplay and world building are 
        spectacular. 
        <br>
        you usually dont see things build around youre charachter very often nor do shortcutes
        usually there jsut to make a boss run back easier actually matter. if you dont take a 
        shortcut things can die. 
        <br> i had an interesting playthrough as it seemed to never ed but was always fun to 
        just go back too.
