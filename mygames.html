    <h2>
        Hi my name is Skyler and i really like Souls like games.<br>
        I feel souls games are the pinacle of gaming where an RPG mixes
        with a hardcore gritty survival like game. <br>
        I will be going a little more in depth on my favorite soul
        games on different pages.
